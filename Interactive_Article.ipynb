This discrepancy has made the characteristic \"knee\" shape in the \n","double ionization yield versus intensity plot into one of the most dramatic manifestations of electron-electron correlation in nature. The precise mechanism that makes correlation so effective is far from settled. Different scenarios have been proposed to explain the mechanism behind ionization [1-18] and have been confronted with experiments [19,20], the recollision scenario [2,3], in which the ionized electron is hurled back at the ion core by the laser, being in best accord with experiments. In Fig. 1, a typical double ionization probability as a function of the intensity of the laser field is plotted. Similar knees have been observed in experimental data [1,4,20-26] and successfully reproduced by quantal computations on atoms and molecules [5,27-29]. In a recent series of articles [8,9,12,13,29-31] characteristic features of double ionization were reproduced using classical trajectories and this success was ascribed to the paramount role of correlation [12]. Indeed, entirely classical interactions turn out to be adequate to generate the strong two-electron correlation needed for double ionization. \n","\n","In this Letter, we complement the well-known recollision scenario by identifying the organizing principles which explain the statistical properties of the classical trajectories such as ionization probabilities. In addition to the dynamical picture of the ionized electron provided by the recollision scenario, we connect the dynamics of the core electron and the energy flow leading to double ionization to relevant phase space structures (periodic orbits or invariant tori). The resulting picture leads to two verifiable predictions for key points which make up the knee in Fig. 1: namely the laser intensity where nonsequential double ionization is maximal and the intensity where the double ionization is complete. Of course, the saturation intensity emerges naturally in quantum mechanical calculations (e.g., Refs. [5,28]) provided they cover a wide enough intensity range."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"2Wr9MLgaUsuD"},"source":["## Hamiltonian model"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"j0_CCzPWUyaQ"},"source":["We work with the classical Hamiltonian model of the helium atom with soft Coulomb potentials [32,33].

By examining typical trajectories, we notice that the motion of the two electrons tracks, at different times, one of four hyperbolic periodic orbits. Their period is 29 a.u., i.e., much shorter than the duration of the laser pulse (of order 800 a.u.). The projections of two of them, $O_1$ and $O_2$, on the $(x,p_x)$ plane, are displayed in Fig. 2. The two other ones are obtained from $O_1$ and $O_2$ using the symmetries of Hamiltonian (1). In particular, if one electron is on the inner curve in $(x,p_x)$, the second electron is on the outer curve in $(y,p_y)$. Consequently, a typical two-electron trajectory is composed of one electron close to the nucleus (the \"inner\" electron, in blue) and another further away (the \"outer\" electron, in red), with quick exchanges of the roles of each electron.

We notice that for a large set of intensities in the range $[10^{14}, 10^{16}]~ \\mbox{W} / \\mbox{cm}^{2}$, this periodic orbit is located close to $p_y= 0$. For intensities larger than a critical intensity $I_c$, the periodic orbit does not exist, and no major islands of regularity remain. Therefore, it is expected that the sequential double ionization probability is equal to one in this range of intensities, as observed on the probability curve on Fig. 1. The location of the local maximum of the potential of Hamiltonian (3) predicts that the intensity $I_c$ is approximately independent of $\\omega$, and it is given by [$I_c\\approx 16/(27a^4)$](#Figure-1)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"ItL_PfjkoFF1"},"source":["## Figure 4\n","Upper panel: Contour plot of the electron location $y(t)$ of Hamiltonian (3), and Poincaré sections (stroboscopic plot) of selected trajectories in the elliptic central region.

The field drives the outer electron away from the nucleus, leaving the inner electron nearly unaffected by the field because its position remains small. \n","From the recollision process [2,3], the outer electron might come back close to the nucleus during the pulse plateau, if the field amplitude is not too large. In this case, it transfers a part of its energy to the inner electron through the electron-electron interaction term. \n","From then on, two outcomes are possible: If the energy brought in by the outer electron is sufficient for the other electron to escape from the regular region (as in Fig. 3, upper panel), then it might ionize together with the outer electron.

We complement the recollision scenario (which focuses on the outer electron) by providing the phase space picture of the inner electron: In order to ionize the core electron, the energy brought back by the outer electron has to be of order of the energy difference between the core ($y=0$) and the boundary of the stable region ($y=y_m$) of ${\\mathcal H}_2$ (see Fig. 4) which is equal to\n","$$\n","\\Delta {\\mathcal E}_y=2-\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{y_m^2+1}}. \\tag{4}\n","$$\n","A good approximation to $y_m=y_m(E_0)$ is given by the value where the potential is locally maximum, i.e. $E_0= 2y_m/(y_m^2+1)^{3/2}$.\n","The equal-sharing relation which links the classical picture of the outer electron $x$ with the one of the inner electron $y$,\n","$$\n","\\Delta {\\mathcal E}_y=\\frac{{\\mathcal E}_x}{2}= \\frac{\\kappa}{2\\omega^2}\\frac{y_m^2}{(y_m^2+1)^3}, \\tag{5}\n","$$\n","defines (through an implicit equation) the expected value of the field $E_0^{(c)}$ for maximal NSDI, because it describes the case when each outer electron brings back enough energy to ionize the inner electron, while remaining ionized itself. However, fulfilling this energy requirement does not guarantee NSDI: The outcome depends on the number and efficiency of recollisions. The predicted value of the amplitude $E_0^{(c)}$ as given by Eq. (5) corresponds to an intensity $I^{(c)}$ given below which agrees very well with the simulations shown in Fig. 1.\n","In a wide range of frequencies, an accurate expansion of $E_0^{(c)}$ is obtained from Eqs.

When the field $E_0$ is too large, then the outer electron does not recollide since it leaves the interaction region nearly linearly.
